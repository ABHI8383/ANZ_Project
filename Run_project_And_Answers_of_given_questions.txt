How to run the project:

1. Go to Anzrunner.java class
2. Right click -> run as -> Junit test

Result:

Result can see under tab Junit, all the test are passes , can see in the green color



Question:1 what others test would you suggest could be written?

Answer: We can write the following others test cases:

1. We can check by Application type as a joint 
2. We can use number of dependents like 1, 2, 3, etc.
3. We can go by Residental investment as well
4. We can check by by enter amount as a negative for e.g. -800, -500 etc. as a negative test cases.


Question:2 If this test was part of a much larger test set, how would you speed it up?

Answer: 

1. Firstly for a large test set, we have to make different scenario & features in a cucumber features file for understanding better all the test cases.
2. We haven't use the same functionality twice
3. run the scripts in parallel
4. By using faster selectors
5. use only explicit waits because web driver waits for the certain conditions before throwing an exception
6. we have to write good tests for better functionality.

Question:3 Sometimes UI tests can fail unpredictably. For example, the page may not have fully loaded before test automation attempts to click a button on 
a web page. How would you improve reliability of these tests?

Answer:

1. We have to  provide proper link which want to automate
2. understanding the exception or case failed reason & imporve it with good solution
3. using design patterns & follows it
4. Making test framework portable
5. All test cases should be implemented
6. Setup detailed automation tests reporting
7. we have to use soft assertions if you need to make list of related checks on the same page
8. Take screenshots for failure investigation
